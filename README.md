## Techie Calendar

Techie Calendar seeks to solve a notification issue for the WayWard Techies Group. This solution is a holistic approach in that it replaces their existing calendar with an interactive version. This interactive version will give new users the opportunity to join a the bi-weekly meeting by clicking on the event in the calendar, subsequently sending them a google calendar invite. There, google's notification system will keep them up to date on the recurring event.
